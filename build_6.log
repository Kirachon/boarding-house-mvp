Type error: Conversion of type 'GenericStringError[]' to type 'WorkOrder[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'GenericStringError' is not comparable to type 'WorkOrder'.
    Type '{ error: true; } & String' is missing the following properties from type '{ id: string; grievance_id: string | null; room_id: string | null; tenant_id: string | null; vendor_id: string | null; title: string; description: string | null; priority: "low" | "medium" | "high"; ... 8 more ...; updated_at: string; }': id, grievance_id, room_id, tenant_id, and 13 more.
